We’re so scared of Mathematics. **Why?** because,

> **We Fear What We Don’t Understand.**

But why we are so scared of Mathematics? Simply It’s because of our high school
teaching systems and very less resource to learn from in our early ages. I saw
many of friends didn’t understand and were scared of Mathematics in high school
but started to love it when they joined Universities. Math is an essential part
of our lives. We need it everyday, in our daily activities. But when you’re a
programmer or a problem solver you need the mathematics most. Because math simply
make a person more logical, creative and intelligence. To be a better programmer
one must know at least a very little of Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Calculus,
Probability, Cryptography, Geometry and Statistics. That’s why I’ve created this
list for you to get started. So that you can start thinking in Mathematical Way.
So don’t waste your time and start learning mathematics from the below list

—> \*\*UPDATE: I’ve prioritized this list from beginner level to intermediate to hard
and by which one to learn first (Being number 1 is most important to learn in
all sections)
